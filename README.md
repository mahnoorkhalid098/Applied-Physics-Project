# 💧 Water Level Indicator - Applied Physics Project

This repository contains a video demonstration and brief documentation of a **Water Level Indicator** project developed as part of our Applied Physics coursework. The project showcases the practical application of basic physics and electronics principles to design a simple system for monitoring water levels in tanks or reservoirs.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Water Level Indicator is designed to:
- Detect and display the water level in a tank using sensors (e.g., probes or float switches).
- Alert users via LEDs or buzzers when the tank reaches low or high water levels.
- Reduce water wastage and prevent overflow by providing real-time monitoring.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

The system uses:
- **Conductive probes** or **float switches** placed at different heights inside the tank.
- When water touches a probe, it completes a circuit and turns on a corresponding **LED**.
- A **buzzer** can be added to notify when the water is too low or about to overflow.
- Powered by a low-voltage DC power source, ensuring safety and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Components Used

- 5V DC Power Supply
- Conductive Metal Wires / Probes
- LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Buzzer (optional)
- Resistors
